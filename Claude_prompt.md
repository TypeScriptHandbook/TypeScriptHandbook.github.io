The book demonstrates the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript. Therefore:
- The examples must be kept in the order they appear in the markdown chapter
- The examples must be distinguished according to the markdown block tag: ```ts or ```js
- The resulting example files must have the corresponding extension: .ts or .js
- JavaScript (.js) files should be tested with JavaScript and not TypeScript
- TypeScript (.ts) files should be tested with TypeScript
