# Preface

This book is for developers who have a firm grasp of two or more programming languages, but not JavaScript or TypeScript.
The goal is to quickly give the experienced programmer a tour of the language,
including all the odd and obscure bits so you aren't flummoxed when you see them in practice.

Because you know two or more languages, you've seen similarities and differences between languages.
From experience, you know the concepts and what to expect from a language, you just don't know the details of how TypeScript does it.

I vibe-wrote this book using ChatGPT, as an experiment.
I started with the book's structure and chapter outlines, then generated each chapter one at a time.
This required asking for a lot of expansions and corrections and regularly required hand-adjustments.
It was a lot easier than without an LLM, and to be honest, it would have seemed too big and distracting without that help.
However, it still took effort, editing, reviewing, and LLM coaching.

## Inception

Bill Frasure, James Ward and I worked for four years on _Effect Oriented Programming_, and we're still trying to figure out how to explain those concepts clearly.
When the team working on the TypeScript Effect library reached out and asked that we translate the book to this new language and library, we were hesitant.
None of us knew TypeScript (TS), and although the library was based on ZEO (which we used in the book), 
there were a lot of foreign ideas in the language and Effect library.
JavaScript (JS) has a ... checkered past, and TypeScript is a compromise language to make transition easier for JavaScript programmers.
Because of this, we acknowledged (at least I think we did) that the learning curve would be bigger than we might expect.

JS/TS has a syntax that, upon first glance, looks familiar enough that we thought we could cargo-cult our way through.
But as I started working into the Effect docs, I found them casually using things that were really quite puzzling.
After delving into a few of these weird features, I had a "we're-not-in-Kansas-anymore" moment (from Wizard of Oz).
I realized I needed to actually learn this language if I was going to deal with it.

Then I realized Bill and James would also need this information.
I wondered if I could herd ChatGPT into creating the book that the three of us needed.
If I could get that acceleration from an LLM, I might as well start and see how it goes.
After I started, I remembered that writing a book is a very effective way for me to learn a language.

* What structural typing really means
* Advantages and caveats
* Mental models for navigating the system

---

### Section 2: Core Language Tour

#### Chapter 2.1: Types, Literals, and Primitives

* Function types and overloads
* Optional/default/rest parameters
* Function expression vs. declaration

#### Chapter 2.3: Objects, Interfaces, and Type Aliases

* Declaring shape types
* Extending and intersecting types
* Index signatures and excess property checks

#### Chapter 2.4: Arrays, Tuples, and Readonly Types

* Tuple inference and labels
* `readonly` modifiers and immutability

#### Chapter 2.5: Enums and Const Assertions
