# Preface

The target audience for this book is developers who have a firm grasp of two or more programming languages, but not JavaScript or TypeScript.
By knowing two or more languages, you've seen similarities and differences between languages, and can thus absorb TypeScript through the structure used in this handbook.
The goal is to quickly give the experienced programmer a tour of the language, including all the odd and obscure bits so you aren't flummoxed when you see them in practice.

I vibe-wrote this book using ChatGPT.
I started with the book's structure and chapter outlines, then generated each chapter one at a time.
This required asking for a lot of expansions and corrections and regularly required hand-adjustments.
