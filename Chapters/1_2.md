# The Rise of TypeScript

TypeScript was first released in 2012, when JavaScript's limitations were becoming painfully obvious to developers building large-scale applications. By this point, JavaScript had evolved beyond its origins in front-end scripting and was being used to power full client-server applications. Teams needed better tooling, better guarantees, and better support for maintainable codebases. JavaScript was flexible, but it wasn’t scalable.

Microsoft, with its experience developing languages like C# and managing enormous codebases, saw the opportunity to bring the benefits of static typing to JavaScript. Rather than creating an entirely new language, they decided to build a superset that extended JavaScript with a powerful optional type system.

## Early Design Goals

From the beginning, TypeScript was designed to be:

* **Gradual**: You could add types where needed, without rewriting existing code
* **Compatible**: All valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript
* **Ergonomic**: Designed with IDE support in mind, with features like intelligent autocomplete, go-to-definition, and real-time error checking

This meant that adopting TypeScript didn’t require developers to abandon the JavaScript ecosystem. TypeScript files could import and export from regular `.js` files and could be incrementally introduced into existing projects.

## Influences and Inspirations

TypeScript was influenced by multiple languages:

* **C#**: TypeScript's syntax and class structure reflect its lineage from C#, which was also designed by Anders Hejlsberg
* **Java**: Interfaces and nominal-looking class hierarchies felt familiar to Java developers
* **ML and Haskell**: TypeScript borrowed advanced type features like discriminated unions and type inference from the functional programming world

Despite these inspirations, TypeScript maintained a distinctly JavaScript sensibility. It never tried to enforce nominal typing or full runtime safety. Instead, it focused on offering just enough structure to improve productivity, without fighting the underlying language.

## Widespread Adoption

TypeScript adoption accelerated dramatically once major frameworks and libraries began embracing it. Angular 2 was one of the first large projects to fully commit to TypeScript. Later, the React ecosystem embraced TypeScript more gradually, but eventually came to treat it as a first-class citizen.

Today, many major open-source projects are written in TypeScript, and companies large and small use it to tame complex codebases.

TypeScript has become not just a popular tool, but a lens through which many developers now view JavaScript. It provides a type-safe vocabulary for describing code, enabling collaboration at scale.

By understanding how and why TypeScript was designed, you'll be better prepared to interpret its compromises, appreciate its expressiveness, and avoid misusing it as a poor approximation of some other language.

TypeScript is not "JavaScript with types". It is a carefully balanced system, designed to improve developer experience while remaining true to its roots.
