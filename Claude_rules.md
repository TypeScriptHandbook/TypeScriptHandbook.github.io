- Make all examples complete so they can be copied and run
- Use active voice in prose
- Watch for phrases like "let you" that can be removed
- When writing TypeScript/JavaScript code:
  - Do not use semicolons unless necessary
- When writing Python code, use the most modern idioms:
  - Prefer dataclasses 
  - Prefer pattern matching to chains of `if`s
  - Use modern Python 3.13 type annotations everywhere
  - Use builtins e.g., `list` rather than importing `List`
  - Use `| None` instead of `Optional`
